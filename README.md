# Final-Project

The primary objective of this project is to develop a program that simulates the forces encountered in ground holding wall scenarios and calculates the resulting mechanical stresses using finite element methods. By analyzing these stresses, we can determine the effectiveness of different anchor placement strategies.
<br/>
To achieve this, we leverage various machine learning techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, q-learning, gradient descent, and branch and bounds. These methods allow us to explore and identify improvements in anchor placement strategies. By applying machine learning algorithms, we can efficiently analyze a vast number of possible configurations to discover optimal solutions.
<br/>
To ensure the reliability of our results, we compare them with published data on real ground holding walls. By validating our findings against established benchmarks, we can verify the accuracy and effectiveness of our program. This comparison provides valuable insights into the performance of our optimization strategies and enhances their practical applicability.
<br/>
The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize the design and construction of ground holding walls. By optimizing anchor positions, we can enhance the stability and durability of these structures, making them more resilient against external forces and ensuring the safety of infrastructure and surrounding areas.
